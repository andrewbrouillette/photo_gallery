Photo Album

This is my photo album project that will show the photo ID, the title of that photo and the link to that photo

This has the photo gallery project in both C# and python. 

To run the console application, you must first run the "photo_gallary.py" file in your IDE.
You will then enter a number between 1-100 next to "Photo Album: " in the console.

Press Enter

This will pull up that specific Photo album along with the Photo ID, Title, and Link for each photo in that album.

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask!
