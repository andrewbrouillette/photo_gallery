Photo Album

This is my photo album project that will show the photo ID, the title of that photo and the URL to that photo

This program is in C#. 

To run the console application, you must first open the "photo_gallary" solution in your IDE. 
Run the "photo_gallery.cs" file
You will then enter a number between 1-100 next to "Photo Album: " in the console.

Press Enter

This will pull up that specific Photo album along with the Photo ID, Title, and URL for each photo in that album.

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask!
